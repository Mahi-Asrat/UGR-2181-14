This experience not only allowed me to excel academically but also provided me with the opportunity to forge meaningful friendships and boost my self-assurance. As I transitioned to the next phase of my educational journey, 
                I carried with me the valuable lessons learned and the confidence gained from my time at Victory Academy.

At LCCS, we strongly believe that every person deserves an environment that promotes personal development, nurtures potential, 
                    and fosters a sense of belonging. Throughout my time there, I gained a deep appreciation for the importance of 
                    diligent effort and was fortunate to be exposed to a diverse range of school clubs, which significantly broadened my perspective on potential career paths. </p>

                        <q> You are the field wherein no seed was  sowed, and yet from you came the fruit of life.
                         You are the treasure-chest which Joseph bought and received from within a precious gem which was our saviour Jesus Christ.
                         You carried him and brought him forth into the world. Ask for us Holy. </q> </p>
