              <h3> Elementary School (2002-2008 EC) </h3>
              <img src="../files/elementary.jpg" alt="Elementary School">
              <p> At Victory Academy, I successfully completed my Kindergarten and elementary education, achieving consistently high ranks and grades throughout my time there. This experience not only allowed me to excel academically but also provided me with the opportunity to forge meaningful friendships and boost my self-assurance. As I transitioned to the next phase of my educational journey, 
                I carried with me the valuable lessons learned and the confidence gained from my time at Victory Academy.
              </p>

                <img src="../files/school.jpg" alt="LCCS">
                <p> I successfully finished my high school education at Lideta Catholic Cathedral School, which is recognized as one of Ethiopia's highly respected educational institutions. At LCCS, we strongly believe that every person deserves an environment that promotes personal development, nurtures potential, 
                    and fosters a sense of belonging. Throughout my time there, I gained a deep appreciation for the importance of diligent effort and was fortunate to be exposed to a diverse range of school clubs, which significantly broadened my perspective on potential career paths. </p>

                <p> Presently, I am enrolled in the Software Engineering program at Addis Ababa University Institute of Technology. While initially, I faced some challenges adjusting to the new lifestyle and academic demands, 
                    I have gradually acclimated and adapted to my surroundings. During my time here, I am excited about the prospect of acquiring fresh knowledge, meeting new individuals, and gaining different perspectives.</p>

                     <p> This study includes the rehearsal of the daily orthodox prayer commonly known as the <strong> Praise of St. Mary. </strong> </p>
                        <p> For instance one part of the Tuesday's prayer goes like:
                        <q> You are the field wherein no seed was  sowed, and yet from you came the fruit of life.
                         You are the treasure-chest which Joseph bought and received from within a precious gem which was our saviour Jesus Christ.
                         You carried him and brought him forth into the world. Ask for us Holy. </q> </p>
